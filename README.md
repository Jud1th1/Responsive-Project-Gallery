## Overview
-	Responsive gallery webpage featuring some of my projects

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size


### Links

- Live Site URL: https://judithsgallery.netlify.app/

## My process
-	After adding some html for my file I followed along with the W3Schools Responsive Image Gallery tutorial to edited my stylesheet to meet the project requirements. Each image was placed in a container that had the same properties as the others on the page, the only difference being the images, the text and links that followed.
-	I added an image overlay to change the image when the mouse hovers and has differentiating text that prompts the user to click and be redirected to the link with the actual code. Tutorial here. The href link was wrapped around the overlay since this would be what the user clicks.
-	To clean up the document a bit, I centered my text, added a line decoration at the top and inset border decoration around each image container. 


### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Desktop-first workflow


### What I learned

-	This exercise provided me a great oppurtunity to practice responsive pages, image overlays and item layouts.  

Code I am proud of:
```css
/**** My border decoration! ****/

div.gallery {
    border: 2px solid #04AA6D;
    border-style: inset;
    background: white;
  }
```
